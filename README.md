# -Rap-lyrics-analysis-using-Genius-API

Using the Genius API, I'm looking to Ô¨Ånd the most common words artist are using in all their songs. Then using R's tidytext package to run sentimental analysis on the word's musicians are using in the lyrics.
This is just a personal project. I wanted to learn how I can combine Python and R,while being able to see the differnt features both languages can bring in terms of packagages.
